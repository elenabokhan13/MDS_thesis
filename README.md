# MDS_thesis

This repository contains programming code and dataset for my thesis on content moderation. 

The data used for training and testing the model was acquired at Kaggle. I also parsed fresh YouTube comments in order to test the final model on new real data. To make parsed comments suitable I had to add manually negative and spam comments (YouTube deletes them automatically and the comments we see are already all benign).

In order to test models by yourself please have a look at ipynb file.
